We are looking at a sales dataset that contains product sales information throughout the United States. The dataset contains various customer-related details, including customer names, order and shipment dates, product names, product categories and subcategories, profit made, and so on. This dataset is commonly known as a Sample Superstore dataset. We analyzed this dataset to compare sales and profit from each segment, year, and quarter. 
We also created a map to show the sales across different states in the USA.
Let’s see the kind of information we can derive from the store data set -: 
Overall store sales and performance: The first natural step is to acquire a sense of the store’s performance throughout time. In addition, we must determine which region is more profitable or loss-making than others. 
The performance of various states: These states can be mapped in order to comprehend various scenarios. For example, a company may decide to invest more in a state with lower sales but higher earnings. If sales are up but earnings are down in another state, that could be a red flag. 
The performance of various customer categories: It’s also crucial for the company to understand which client segments are generating sales and profitability in various categories. 
Sales generation by category: We can acquire statistics on specific product categories and how they compare (in terms of sales and profits) within specified geographies and customer segments.
